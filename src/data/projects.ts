We focus on supporting the comercial side of the art market so that artist doesn't have to waist time learning about facebook.\n\n This is a startup that I founded in 2022. I started from the question 'why are so many good artist starving even now days?' it was a long way of finding out the reasons and shapes of the market. but we manage to make a working BM that benefits both artists and collector."

    description: "Humans have long explored the differences between animals and humans, even bringing aliens into the discourse, to justify their status as special beings. However, 'human-ness' is now being challenged by similar entities like AI. To explore the boundaries of 'human-ness,' \n\nI created a digital life form that thinks, behaves, and looks identical to C. elegans (roundworm). The worm was mimicked across three levels:Functional Level: Based on the worm's genome map, its neural structure was simulated in a computer to react identically to the actual organism.Morphological Level: A generative model trained on worm images was used to create a similar external appearance.Structural Level: The relationship between the worm and higher-order organisms parallels the relationship between early AI and humans. \n\n This allows us to think metaphorically about our position and perspective.Through this work, I aim to explore the boundaries between biological and non-biological, digital and analog, creator and created, and reconsider humanity's place in nature.This project overlays a learned exterior appearance onto simulated C. elegans movements. C. elegans is one of the few organisms with a fully mapped genome, and when its neurons are implemented in a computer, they respond to stimuli identical to actual larvae. The implementation was created using the Openworms project video, combined with Pix2Pix model, Ebsynth, and post-processing techniques.",
